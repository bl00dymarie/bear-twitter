* Ruby version

Due to configuration of our web app based on twitter's "Application-only authentication" (see https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/application-only), the usage of twitter is restricted.

"Your app will be able to, for example:

    Pull user timelines;
    Access friends and followers of any account;

    Search for users;
    Use any geo endpoint;
    Access DMs or account credentials;
